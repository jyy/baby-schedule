1. setup webserver and serve the entire src.  for example, install lighttpd and create symlink in www root to baby-scheduler src files.
2. copy activities.csv to same directory as parser.rb
3. ruby parser.rb
4. open in browser (e.g. http://localhost/baby-scheduler/baby-scheduler.html)

TODOs:
-generate only if source csv has changed
