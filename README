1. setup webserver and serve the entire src.  for example, install lighttpd and create symlink in www root to baby-scheduler src files.
2. copy activities.csv to same directory as parser.rb
3. ruby parser.rb
4. open in browser (e.g. http://localhost/baby-scheduler/baby-scheduler.html)

Notes:
-depends on Less css so must need IE 6+, Webkit, or Firefox.  see http://lesscss.org

TODOs:
-specify csv source from command line args
-generate only if source csv has changed
-get rid of Less as it was just used to generate the hour marker styles; will check-in generated css
